  Name: Sugar Cookies

  Ingredients:
  flour, salt, baking soda, butter, sugar, egg, milk, vanilla extract

  Recipe:
  1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk liquids together in small areas around the bowl, then all together to avoid separation.

  2. Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients; stir until flour is thoroughly mixed in. Stir in the chocolate chips.

  3. Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 2 hours.

  4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

  5. Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and place on prepared baking sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between cookies (about 8 per sheet). Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Slide parchment and cookies onto a cooling rack for a few minutes. Remove parchment and finish cooling the cookies on the rack.

  Name: Cheesy Potato Casserole

  Do you have those family recipes that you make every holiday season without fail? In our family, we have a few, and they’re what I call super “old school” recipes. These are the classics that my brothers love more than anything. And they’re the ones we’ve been eating since I was a kid. You have those recipes too, right?

  We always do a cheesy potato casserole at Christmas. But a few years ago I decided I wanted to make something new and updated. I knew I had to keep the flavors pretty simple and classic. I also knew I wanted an easy side dish that I could prepare ahead of time and not have to worry about. Enter this casserole. It’s easy to throw together, but so incredibly delicious, and it’s pretty much guaranteed to be loved by all.

  Cheesy potatoes are one of those old school recipes. They’re without a doubt a tried and true favorite. Meaning they’re never not delicious, everyone who tries them loves them. I’m sure many of you have similar casseroles in your family. I know some call them funeral potatoes (which seems really depressing to me). Call um what you please, but in our house, they’re just cheesy potatoes.

  My mom’s recipe called for frozen potatoes, canned cream of chicken soup, sour cream, butter, cheese, and a few other ingredients. I decided to take her recipe and give it my own spin, updating a classic, and making it BETTER. I’d actually been wanting to do this for years but feared I wouldn’t be able to create something better.

  But a few years back I decided I’d had enough with the canned soup (because it freaks me out and I will not eat it…so yes, I used to miss out on cheesy potatoes every year). I knew it was time to update the cheesy potatoes recipe. Thankfully the new version turned how better than I could have imagined. This casserole is SO GOOD.

  Name: French Bread

  If you’re looking for an easy french bread recipe, this is it! You’ll have 2 beautiful loaves in 90 minutes. The actual time you’ll be working will only be about 15 minutes, the rest of the time will be patiently waiting for the dough to rest/rise. This homemade french bread is golden and crispy on the outside, while remaining soft and slightly chewy on the inside. We love to serve it with a bowl of warm soup and the first time I made it, my husband said “this bread is SO good, where did you get it?” He thought I picked it up from our local bakery. It is just that good and really so easy to make. You’ll never want to buy store bought french bread again.

  I absolutely love making bread and rolls of all kinds. There’s something so satisfying about making them in your own kitchen. The smell is unbelievable. We love to serve this homemade french bread with softened butter, honey and/or jam. So so good. Trust me when I say, this is the best french bread recipe!
